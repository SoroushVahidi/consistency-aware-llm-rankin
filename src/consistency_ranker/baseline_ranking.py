baseline_ranking.py
===================
Simple baseline ranking methods that do not require cycle removal.

Methods
-------
score_sum_ranking:
    Rank items by their total outgoing preference weight ("wins").  This is
    analogous to a sum-of-scores approach and works even on cyclic graphs.

topological_ranking:
    Rank items by a topological sort of the graph.  Only valid on DAGs; raises
    an error if the graph contains cycles.

borda_ranking:
    Rank items by Borda count: each win over another item contributes 1 point.
    Equivalent to score_sum_ranking with uniform weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph:

    -------
    list[str]
